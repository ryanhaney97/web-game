#Web-game

##Overview

This is something I whipped up in order to play around with the core.async clojure library. Currently only supports basic movement via the arrow keys. I plan on possibly expanding this into a bullet hell game, which will be interesting if the engine can handle it.

##Changelog

Version 0.0.2 - Added support for bullets! Also moved the screen a bit in order to make room for a status screen on the right side of the screen.

Version 0.0.1 - Initial Commit

##Todo

- Bullet Collision
- Screen restrictions
- Everything Else
